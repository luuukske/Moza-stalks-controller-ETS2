# Moza-stalks-controller-ETS2
This controller make driving with the MOZA multi-function stalks easier with ETS2 and ATS. it uses the SDK provided by the game devs to get realtime game data. this makes it easier so set light modes and wipers.

the controller also makes it possible to tap the turn signal stalk, and it will turn on for 3 blinks.
the turn signal also turn off if it physically returns (as it should).
